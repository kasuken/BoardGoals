# Help üÜò

This list of the goals should be helpful for you and should not be a source of stress.
It helps to stay motivated during the entire year and to register your progress.

If you don't achieve a goal, it doesn't matter, but keep pushing hard to achieve your goals!

## Due Date
You can set your due date. It's not mandatory that it's the last day of the current year.
But remember, don't set too much goals.
You can add goals every time, so, start with less goals and add them later.
It's better for your motivation.

## Goal description

- Use [Emojis](https://emojipedia.org/) in the title
- Always use a progress badge

## Progress Badge

I have used [shields.io](https://shields.io/) for creating the badge. It's very simple to create one.

**Example:**
For instance, if you want to create a badge of 30% completed Resolutions

`https://img.shields.io/badge/<progress/completed>-<% of completition>25-<color>.svg`

you have to replace <% of completition> with **30**

and the output will be

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/progress-30%25-yellow.svg)

Example of progress colors

| Progress in % | Color     |
| ------------- | --------- |
| 0-20%         | red       |
| 21-60%        | yellow    |
| 61-99%        | green     |
| 100%          | darkgreen |

## Archive
Don't delete the old Board Goals.
Archive them in a folder called "Archive" in the root and set a name like "BoardGoals2020.md".
